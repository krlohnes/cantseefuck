# ❓ Have YOU ever thought Brainfuck was TOO LEGIBLE?!

### Then BOY do we have the solution for you!

Are you sick of seeing code?  
Do `+` and `>` feel like *hand-holding* for your elite hacker brain?  
Are you ready to enter a world where even your **own text editor** can’t help you anymore?

## 👁️‍🗨️ **CantSeeFuck**  
> The esolang that puts the “invisible” in “incomprehensible”!

### 🤯 What is CantSeeFuck?

CantSeeFuck is **Brainfuck**, lovingly reimagined for those who think visible characters are for the weak.  
We’ve replaced the original, boring visible symbols with only the most **l33t whitespace characters**.

With CantSeeFuck, your code becomes:
- Invisible ✅  
- Untraceable ✅  
- Unforgivable ✅

Why write:
```
>+[-<+]
```
When you could write:
```

 	
  	

```

That's right: **you literally can't see fuck.**

### 🔍 Character Mapping

| Brainfuck | CantSeeFuck         | Unicode Name              |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| `>`       | ` `                 | U+0020 SPACE               |
| `<`       | `\t`                | U+0009 CHARACTER TAB       |
| `+`       | `\n`                | U+000A LINE FEED           |
| `-`       | `\x0C`              | U+000C FORM FEED           |
| `.`       | `\r`                | U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN     |
| `,`       | `\x0B`              | U+000B VERTICAL TAB        |
| `[`       | `\u{00A0}`          | U+00A0 NON-BREAKING SPACE  |
| `]`       | `\u{2007}`          | U+2007 FIGURE SPACE        |

Because nothing says *“elite programming”* like confusing your terminal, your editor, and yourself in one go.
